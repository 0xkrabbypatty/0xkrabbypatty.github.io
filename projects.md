## Undergraduate Thesis
One of the University of Oregon Clark Honors College graduation requirements is to write and defend a thesis on a topic related to your major. For my thesis I am doing an econometrics analysis on relationships between blockchain consensus mechanisms and network externalities. I plan on defending the thesis this Winter! You can view the first draft [here]([https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pr-ixPvci81nLnVvlmBLHkoGM5X6j50n92KT-eMeXog/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16ZUINWFIkPFExc1we7ccSwEegZx4kUpJYu-BmdNn_iA/edit?usp=sharing))

## Pilots License
I started working on a private pilots license summer 2021 after I got back from Alaska, but had to put it on hold summer 2022 as I got busy with my internship and studying for the LSAT. Going to try and do the check ride summer 2023! No solo yet, but was getting pretty good at all the different touch and go's before I took a break. 

## Programming
I am trying to learn more about programming because I think knowing how to read code will be a very useful skill in the future. Recently I have been doing a lot of R for my econometrics classes. I am also working through the Rustlings excercises in my free time as well as the occasional Solidity project!

## Writing
I occasionally post some longer form writing at [krabbypatty.substack.com](https://krabbypatty.substack.com/).
