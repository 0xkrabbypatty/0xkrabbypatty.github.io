Hi! I am an undergraduate at the University of Oregon studying economics. I like reading about the impact of technology in real world situations. Topics such as product-market fit, the estimation of treatment effects through quantitative research like diff-in-diff experiments, and any legal/ethics considerations of how technology should be used are very interesting to me. Current areas of interests are DeFi, AI/ML, FOSS, and privacy! You can find me on [github](https://github.com/0xkrabbypatty) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/joe314158).
