Hi! I am an undergraduate at the University of Oregon studying economics. I like reading about the impact of technology in real world situations. Topics such as product-market fit, the estimation of treatment effects through quantitative research, and any legal/ethics considerations of how technology should be used are very interesting to me. Current areas of interests are statistical/machine learning, cryptography, networking and protocol design of distributed systems, and privacy!
