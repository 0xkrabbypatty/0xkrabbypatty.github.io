Hi! I am an undergraduate at the University of Oregon studying economics. I love reading and learning about the impact of technology in real world situations. This includes product-market fit, the estimation of treatment effects through quantitative research like diff-in-diff experiments, and any legal/ethics considerations of how technology should be used! Current areas of interests are DeFi, AI/ML, FOSS, and privacy. You can find me on [github](https://github.com/0xkrabbypatty) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/joe314158)
