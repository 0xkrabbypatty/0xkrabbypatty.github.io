This post keeps track of some personal projects I am working on for fun, school, or jobs

## Undergraduate Thesis
One of the University of Oregon Clark Honors College graduation requirements is to write and defend a thesis on a topic related to your major. For my thesis, I am doing an econometrics analysis on relationships between blockchain consensus mechanisms and network resistance to majority attacks. Specifically, this means looking at relationships between design choices of blockchains and economic factors, and looking at whether there are any statistically significant relationships with Nakamoto Coefficients. I plan on defending the thesis this Winter and will post it here once it is done!

## Pilots License
Started working on a private pilots license summer 2021 after I got back from Alaska, but had to put it on hold summer 2022 as I got busy with my internship and studying for the LSAT. Going to try and do the check ride summer 2023! No solo yet, but was getting pretty good at all the different touch and go's before I took a break. 

## Programming
I am trying to learn more about programming because I think knowing how to read code will be a very useful skill in the future. I did some Java and Python in highschool although didn't touch code for a long time after that. Recently, I have been doing a lot of R for my econometrics classes. I plan on learning some Rust and Python in the future!
